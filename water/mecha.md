#### The context

You are a researcher trying to discover a variety of millet that is more tolerant to drought. You suspect that *aquaporins* (water channels) are key regulators in increasing water availability for the plant through modification of root permeability. Little variability exists in genes regulating aquaporin expression in high-potential ("V0") millet varieties. However, this variability exists in nature, and you can cross the high-potential variety with natural varieties ("V1-4") to import new genes into the existing pool.

You have varieties with the following characteristics:

- V1 : Increased expression of aquaporins in the *epidermis* (first cell layer on the root surface), doubling the permeability of epidermal membranes;

- V2 : Increased expression of aquaporins in the *cortex* (tissue containing the largest cell surface area), doubling the permeability of cortical membranes;

- V3: Increased expression of aquaporins in the *endoderm* (tissue supporting the Caspary frame), doubling the permeability of endodermal membranes;

- V4: Increased expression of aquaporins in the *Xylemic parenchyma* (tissue surrounding the xylemic vessels), doubling the permeability of the membranes in the stele;

#### The questions

Creating a hybrid variety bringing together genes of interest requires a lot of time, and carrying out a preliminary study using a modeling tool makes it possible to test a priori which crossing would be the most promising to modify root permeability.

Use MECHA to answer the following questions and develop explanations:

- What is the impact of endoderm suberization on root permeability?

- Which hybrid (V0 - V?) would a priori allow the greatest increase in root permeability in the area with an unsuberized Caspary frame?

- How does the permeability of this hybrid vary compared to the variety V0, in the more mature area where the endoderm is suberized?

- What factors other than aquaporins limit root permeability?
